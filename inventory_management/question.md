**Project Idea: Inventory Management System with Low Inventory Email Notifications**

**Project Description:**
Create an Inventory Management System that allows businesses to efficiently manage their product inventory while also providing email notifications for low inventory levels. The system helps businesses keep track of their products, monitor stock levels, track sales and purchases, and receive email alerts when inventory falls below a certain threshold.This project can be a valuable tool for businesses to efficiently manage their inventory and receive timely alerts to restock products when necessary.

**Key Features:**
1. **User Authentication:** Implement user accounts with roles such as admin, manager, and staff to control access and permissions.
2. **Product Management:** Users can add, edit, and delete products with details like name, description, price, and quantity.
3. **Inventory Tracking:** Keep track of stock levels and automatically update them when sales or purchases occur.
4. **Sales and Purchases:** Record sales and purchases, including the date, quantity, and price.
5. **Low Inventory Email Notifications:** Set up email notifications for low stock levels, so users receive alerts when inventory is below a defined threshold.
6. **Alert Threshold Configuration:** Allow users to set custom low inventory alert thresholds for each product.
7. **Reporting:** Generate reports on sales, purchases, and current inventory status. Provide insights into product performance and trends.
8. **Search and Filter:** Enable users to search for products and filter data based on various criteria.
9. **Supplier and Customer Management:** Store information about suppliers and customers for easy reference.


**Tech Stack:**

- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT or OAuth.
- **Email Service**: Integrate an email service (e.g., SendGrid) to send low inventory email notifications.
- **Reporting Library**: Integrate a reporting library (e.g., ReportLab) for generating PDF reports.
